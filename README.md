This tool allows you to paste any website content giving opening hours of a place and returns a value for the `opening_hours`-tag.

This tool is based on a [Geometa Lab HSR project on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/geometalab/web-to-osm-opening-hours/blob/master/README.md) but as this currently seems to be out of maintenance, I've moved my original codepen version of the project here.
